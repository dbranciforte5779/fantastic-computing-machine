			<p>My name is Diego Branciforte. I am 17 years old and currently attending Cox Mill High School for my senior year. I was born and raised in San Diego, California, but I've lived in several different places across the United States due to my dad serving in the military. My interests lie in computers and their numerous applications. Ever since the start of highschool I've been learning various programming languages and Adobe softwares so that I can become skilled in both backend and frontend development.</p>
			<p>This website is a small project to showcase my web development skills as of February 28, 2022. As for why I chose to focus on Italy, in the summer of 2019 my family left our comfortable home in North Carolina to experience a small taste of what Europe has to offer. Throughout the trip we visited Austria, France, Spain, Germany, as well as a few other countries, but the one that spurred my excitement the most was none other than Italy. The architecture within the cities and towns, combined with the landscapes of the countryside are immensely aesthetically pleasing and fill me with a distinct sense of bliss that can only be derived from observing the sights in person. My hope is that the few people who visit this site can at least leave with a new appreciation for this beautiful country.</p>
